        "# Abstract\n",
        "\n",
        "Our project aims to predict the probability of a wicket on a delivery in Cricket. We will look at ball-by-ball factors that could potentially affect this probability and see how the wicket probability changes with game conditions. Forecasting methods for cricket use complex regression models as discussed by @asif2016play, which is why we decided against predicting win probability, a common prediction model used for sports.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Cricket is a bat and ball sport involving two teams of eleven players each. Originating in the 16th century, Cricket today is commonly played in three formats: Tests, One Day Internationals and T20 Internationals. Our analysis will be specifically focusing on T20 International games and looking at the conditions of those games to analyze our prediction probability. In a T20 game, one team will bat first and set a target number of runs in 20 overs or until 10 wickets are lost. The other team will bat second, and to win the game, they must exceed the target set by the second team in 20 overs or less. Each of the 11 players in the team will need to bat as more wickets are lost, but some bat more often than others, given all wickets are not always lost. Only some players are bowlers. There are multiple different ways of getting a wicket, and these can be affected by the following factors:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Bowler: The skill of a bowler can affect the probability\n",
        "2. Batter: Similarly, the skill of a batter can affect the probability\n",
        "3. Inning: Determines which team is batting and bowling\n",
        "4. Over: An over consists of 6 deliveries thrown by the bowler from one end of the pitch to the batter on the other end. The over can determine how much risk a batter is willing to take with his next ball.\n",
        "5. Ball in the over: The specific delivery in the over. Batters are more likely to take risks towards the end of an over compared to the beginning.\n",
        "6. Runs scored till now: Looks at the amount of runs scored in the inning up until the current ball. Fewer runs scored may mean the batter is more likely to take risks in order to get more.\n",
        "7. Powerplay: A powerplay is when there are fielding restrictions placed on the bowling team, making it harder for them to get a wicket. \n",
        "\n",
        "We will be looking at the above factors along with some others to judge what factors may be best for our model in the Exploratory Data Analysis section. We will be reading our data in json files from the [Cricsheet](https://cricsheet.org/downloads/) website, and converting it to our desired `csv` format using the scripts in the `cricsheet_json_parsing.ipynb` file which can be found in the `src` folder.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "Firstly, we will perform some exploratory data analysis on the training data to get a better understanding of the dataset and what relationships there are with our target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset contains 28 columns and 510652 observations related to cricket. The ratio of quantitative to categorical (ordinal and nominal) data is approximately 50:50. Note that the columns **player_out, player_out_id, fielder_name, fielders_id, and wicket_type** show a significant amount of missing values. Player_out and player_out_id may be missing due to inapplicability (e.g., no one is out), which results in fielder_name, fielder_id, and wicket_type being invalid in these observations. Thus, these missing data are likely classified as **missing at random(MAR)**. Given the complexity of imputing these values, they are unlikely to be included in our further analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that, among the 28 columns, there were few attributes generated based on existing columns, and they are \"over_ball\", \"inning\", \"runs_cumulative\", and \"powerplay\". Although they are all integers, it is important to note that, only \"overball\" and \"runs_cumulative\" are quantitative, whereas \"inning\" and \"powerplay\" are categorical. Detailed calculations of these attributes are in the `cricsheet-json-parsing.ipynb` file. \n",

        "**Caption:**  @fig-var_dist and @fig-var_dist_2 bar chart illustrates the distribution of all the variables. Note that the analysis excludes all columns related to `ID` as they are primarily for identification purposes and are unlikely to show significant patterns. It is observed that none of the quantitative attributes follow a normal distribution; most are right-skewed distributions. An interesting finding is noted in the attributes `over` in @fig-var_dist, where the frequency **steadily** decreases with increasing values, suggesting further analysis. Concerning ordinal attributes, we have a significantly higher amount of data from seasons that happened in recent years than in the past. \n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of `team` in @fig-var_dist_2, there appear to be more teams from \"New Zealand,\" \"South Africa,\" \"India,\" \"West India,\" \"Pakistan,\" \"Bangladesh,\" \"Sri Lanka\"  \"Australia,\" and \"England\" than teams from other countries/regions. \n",
        "\n",
        "The attribute `inning` in @fig-var_dist_2 doesn't seem to have a significant difference across the two conditions, however, for `powerplay`, the number of occurrences in condition \"0\" is approximately twice as high as in condition \"1.\"\n"

Due to such a large number of batters(@tbl-batter) and bowlers(@tbl-bowler) in the dataset, we will not be using it in our analysis.

        "1. Explorational Data Analysis: The exploration revealed several key insights that influence model building and interpretation. For example, the analysis shows the vast difference in player occurrences.\n",
        "2. Model Building  and Selection: Based on the EDA findings, five features: Inning, over, powerplay, over_ball, and runs_cumulative were chosen based on the statistical relationships.One-hot encoding was applied for categorical variables to avoid introducing bias during model training.Finally, **Logistic Regression** was made due to the binary nature of the target variable (wicket or no wicket).Considering the potential drawbacks of class imbalance, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is not recommended.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Model development:** Understanding the distribution patterns and biases is crucial for choosing appropriate modeling techniques, interpreting outcomes, and guiding future data collection efforts.\n",
        "- **Generalizability:** Addressing non-normality and temporal bias is essential for creating models that perform well on data beyond the training set.\n",
        "- **Player analysis:** Exploring model results can unlock valuable insights into individual player performance and interaction with other factors influencing wicket probability.\n",
        "- **Cricket analytics:** The model's insights can inform cricket analysts and fans about factors that influence wicket probabilities, leading to better predictions and understanding of the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Future Questions and Work\n",
        "\n",
        "These findings lead to several compelling questions for future research:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Addressing non-normality:** How can we effectively transform the data (e.g., log transformation)or utilize specific algorithms to improve model performance in the presence of *non-normal distributions*? \n",
        "\n",
        "- **Mitigating temporal bias:** What data augmentation techniques or alternative approaches can be used to ensure the model generalizes well across different time periods? Mitigating this bias are necessary for broader applicability.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "And the future work includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Feature engineering:** Explore creating additional features or transformations of existing ones to capture more aspects of the game and potentially improve model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Extra information:** @marshall2024talk also discuss how pitch conditions could affect the possibility of a wicket. Having this data would help improve our model significantly.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Model performance evaluation:** Evaluate model perform on test data using appropriate classification performance metrics (e.g., F1-score, ROC AUC) and compare it with other potential models to identify the best approach for the task.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
